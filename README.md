# Group Scheduler

This Web Application has a log-in system. Users must register the and sign in.
After sign in, the user can write, edit, or delete the schedule.
Also, users can see the other memberâ€™s schedules, so it is very useful when the users work with a team.
I created this Web Application with PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS.
